## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-01

Three deployment modes, slimmer install footprint, and first-class
[Comfy Cloud](https://cloud.comfy.org) support — built from a survey of
forks and a port of the cloud-dispatch architecture from
[@picoSols](https://github.com/picoSols)'s `comfyui-cloud-mcp` fork.

### Added

- **Comfy Cloud mode** — set `COMFYUI_API_KEY` to route HTTP-backed primitives
  (enqueue, history, system stats, queue, view, upload) to `cloud.comfy.org`
  with `X-API-Key` authentication. WebSocket-bound and local-FS/process
  tools throw a clear `CLOUD_UNSUPPORTED` error in this mode. New
  `src/comfyui/cloud-client.ts` mirrors the local client interface so the
  rest of the server is transparent to which backend it's talking to.
  Architecture and dispatcher pattern originally shipped by
  [@picoSols](https://github.com/picoSols) in
  [`picoSols/comfyui-cloud-mcp@7a812069`](https://github.com/picoSols/comfyui-cloud-mcp/commit/7a812069).
- **Explicit remote mode + smart-detect** — when `--comfyui-url` points at a
  non-loopback host (anything other than `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1` /
  `0.0.0.0`), the server skips `COMFYUI_PATH` auto-detection. This closes
  the root cause behind the 0.8.1 `upload_*` fix — a stale local install can
  no longer silently absorb uploads/downloads the agent intended for the
  remote target. An explicit `COMFYUI_PATH` env var still wins.
- **`isCloudMode()` / `isRemoteMode()` / `isLocalMode()`** config helpers and
  `COMFYUI_CLOUD_URL` (defaults to `https://cloud.comfy.org`).

### Changed

- **Slim install** — moved seven heavy/feature-gated packages out of
  `dependencies` into `optionalDependencies` and dynamic-import them lazily
  via a new `requireOptionalDep` helper:
  `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@azure/storage-blob`, `cloudflared`,
  `ai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/google`, `@ai-sdk/openai`. A
  `npm install --no-optional comfyui-mcp` now yields a working core server;
  features that need a missing optional dep surface a clear
  `OPTIONAL_DEP_MISSING` error with the exact `npm install <pkg>` hint.

### Documentation

- New "Deployment modes" section in `docs/configuration.mdx` covering the
  local / remote / cloud feature parity matrix and the `COMFYUI_API_KEY` /
  `COMFYUI_CLOUD_URL` env vars.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-01

Bug-fix release picking up upstream contributions from
[@joaolvivas](https://github.com/joaolvivas)'s fork of comfyui-mcp.

### Added

- **`health_check`** — single-call pre-flight diagnostic that reports
  ComfyUI/Python/PyTorch versions, GPU + VRAM, queue depth, per-category
  `/models` populations (catches empty-dropdown surprises from a
  misconfigured `extra_model_paths.yaml`), and recent errors from
  `/internal/logs`. Read-only. Useful before a long batch or when triaging an
  unexplained failure. Originally contributed by
  [@joaolvivas](https://github.com/joaolvivas) in
  [`joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas@de82ecda`](https://github.com/joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas/commit/de82ecda).

### Fixed

- **`search_custom_nodes`** — `api.comfy.org/nodes` accepts a `search` query
  parameter but ignores it server-side, returning the same paginated default
  list regardless of query. We now fetch a larger window (limit=100) and
  rank-filter client-side by id / name / author / description with a
  popularity boost, so query-relevant packs actually appear. Diagnosed and
  patched by [@joaolvivas](https://github.com/joaolvivas) in
  [`joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas@f066b597`](https://github.com/joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas/commit/f066b597);
  port adds a guard so popularity no longer inflates non-matching packs.
- **`upload_image` / `upload_video` / `upload_audio`** — HTTP-only.
  Previously these tools fell back to a local filesystem copy if HTTP upload
  failed and `COMFYUI_PATH` was set. When `COMFYUI_PATH` was auto-detected to
  an unrelated install (common for users targeting a remote `--comfyui-url`),
  the fallback wrote the file to the wrong tree and reported success, while
  the remote ComfyUI never received it — the next `LoadImage` then failed
  mysteriously. Now HTTP-only against the connected ComfyUI's
  `/upload/image` endpoint, which works for both local and remote. Diagnosed
  and patched by [@joaolvivas](https://github.com/joaolvivas) in
  [`joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas@089180ad`](https://github.com/joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas/commit/089180ad).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-26

Completes the custom-node authoring lifecycle, adds cloud storage I/O and
declarative setup, and adds node discovery — all built and reviewed in a
codex implement→review→fix loop.

### Added

- **`apply_manifest`** — declarative environment setup from an inline object or
  a JSON/YAML manifest: `pip` packages, `custom_nodes` (registry ids or git URLs
  with `@ref`), and `models`. Idempotent, per-item structured report; `apt`
  entries are accepted but skipped (manual/root). Local-only.
- **`verify_custom_node`** — the "test" step of the author loop: restarts ComfyUI
  (with a bounded readiness wait) and confirms a pack's `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`
  class_types registered in `/object_info` (a failed import simply never appears).
- **`scaffold_custom_node`** now also emits `.comfyignore`/`.gitignore` and, with
  `with_ci`, a `.github/workflows/publish_action.yml` (Comfy-Org/publish-node-action).
- **`convert_image`** — re-encode a generated image (by `asset_id` or output-dir
  path) to PNG/JPEG/WebP via `sharp`; returns inline base64 + optional file write
  (output-dir confined), and reports bytes saved.
- **Cloud storage** — model downloads may be `s3://` or Azure Blob URLs
  (`download_model` gains `s3` auth); new **`upload_output`** pushes a generated
  output to S3 / Azure / HTTP / Hugging Face and returns URL(s).
- **`download_model` `auth`** — per-request `bearer`/`basic`/`header`/`query`
  authentication for gated/private hosts (carried over and extended).
- **`comfy-researcher` agent** — turns a problem statement into ranked custom-node
  pack recommendations (searches the Registry, evaluates, delegates deep dives to
  `comfy-explorer`).
- **Cached `generate_node_skill`** — read-through cache keyed by source@version
  (`COMFYUI_SKILL_CACHE_DIR`; `refresh` to bypass), so repeat analyses are instant.

### Security

- `apply_manifest` rejects pip argv-option injection; realpath/symlink-safe path
  containment for manifest model paths, `convert_image`, and upload sources;
  `convert_image` caps source size + sharp pixels.
- Cloud storage: Azure SAS / AWS presigned secrets redacted from logs/errors;
  Azure URL-vs-env account mismatch rejected; HF-CLI remote-path argv hardening;
  manual redirect handling (no cross-origin auth replay or upload-redirect SSRF).

### Fixed

- `generate_node_skill` cache resolves the current pack version before lookup
  (no stale docs served after a pack updates) and writes atomically (temp +
  rename with a content-hash check).

### Dependencies

- Added `yaml` (manifest parsing), `sharp` (image conversion), `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
  and `@azure/storage-blob` (cloud storage). `npm audit`: 0 high vulnerabilities.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-25

Stability + authoring release: hardens model downloads and the ComfyUI process
lifecycle, makes failures actionable, and adds a custom-node authoring/publishing
lifecycle. Plus a hosted docs site and an experimental embedded-agent backend.

### Added

- **Custom-node authoring** — `scaffold_custom_node` (generate a Python node pack
  from a template) and `publish_custom_node` (publish to the Comfy Registry via
  comfy-cli; key via `REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, never logged) (#24).
- **`install_custom_node` ref pinning** — pin a pack to a commit/branch/tag, parsed
  from GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket URLs or `repo@ref`, or an explicit `ref` arg.
- **`download_model` auth** — per-request `bearer` / `basic` / `header` / `query`
  authentication for gated/private model hosts.
- **Model download cache** — content-addressed dedup, concurrent-download coalescing,
  and optional LRU eviction (`COMFYUI_DOWNLOAD_CACHE_DIR`, `COMFYUI_LRU_CACHE_SIZE_GB`).
- **ComfyUI process supervision** — bounded startup readiness checks
  (`COMFYUI_STARTUP_CHECK_INTERVAL_S`/`_MAX_TRIES`) and opt-in bounded
  auto-restart-on-crash (`COMFYUI_ALWAYS_RESTART`, `COMFYUI_RESTART_MAX_ATTEMPTS`,
  `COMFYUI_RESTART_WINDOW_S`).
- **Plugin skills** — `comfyui-frontend-extensions` (v2 `@comfyorg/extension-api`
  authoring + v1→v2 migration) and `comfyui-node-registry` (node authoring/publishing).
- **Hosted docs** — Mintlify site with a schema-generated tool reference at
  [comfyui-mcp.artokun.io/docs](https://comfyui-mcp.artokun.io/docs).

### Changed

- **`get_job_status` + completion notifications** now surface ComfyUI
  `execution_error` detail (node id/type, exception type/message, truncated traceback,
  `current_inputs`, OOM flag) and optional per-node + total execution timing.
  Additive and backward-compatible.

### Security

- `download_model` auth inputs are validated (reject CR/LF/control chars; HTTP-token
  header names); query-auth secrets are redacted from logs and error details.
- `install_custom_node` git refs are validated and run via `git checkout
  --end-of-options <ref>`, closing an argv-option-injection vector.
- Spawned ComfyUI children now have `error` listeners so a missing/failed executable
  can't crash the MCP server.

### Experimental

- **Embedded-agent backend POC** (flag-gated via `COMFYUI_MCP_AGENT_POC`): a cloudflared
  quick-tunnel helper + an AI SDK `/api/chat` endpoint with bearer auth, a request body
  cap, and a server-side model allowlist. Not part of default startup. See
  `design/embedded-agent-panel.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.

### Dependencies

- Added `ai` + `@ai-sdk/anthropic`/`openai`/`google` + `cloudflared` (experimental POC)
  and declared `zod-to-json-schema` (docs generation). `npm audit`: 0 high vulnerabilities.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Media upload** — `upload_video` and `upload_audio` copy local video/audio
  files into ComfyUI's input directory so they can be referenced as workflow
  inputs, mirroring the existing `upload_image` (closes #12).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-25

A large feature release that ports much of the [`comfy-cli`](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-cli)
workflow into MCP tools. New tools operate on the connected ComfyUI (local or a
remote `--comfyui-url` target), preferring the ComfyUI-Manager HTTP API with a
subprocess fallback where the API can't do the job.

### Added — comfy-cli capability port

- **Custom-node management** — `install_custom_node`, `update_custom_node`,
  `reinstall_custom_node`, `fix_custom_node`, `list_installed_nodes`,
  `sync_node_dependencies` (#15)
- **Node snapshots** — `save_node_snapshot`, `restore_node_snapshot`,
  `list_node_snapshots`; honors comfy-cli's `.json`/`.yaml` snapshot contract (#13)
- **Node bisect** — `bisect_start`, `bisect_good`, `bisect_bad`, `bisect_reset`,
  `bisect_status` to isolate a faulty custom node; never re-enables packs you had
  disabled before the session (#14)
- **Workflow dependencies** — `extract_workflow_dependencies`,
  `install_workflow_dependencies` (handles API- and UI-format workflows) (#16)
- **Install ComfyUI** — `install_comfyui`: clones ComfyUI (+ ComfyUI-Manager) and
  installs requirements into a dedicated workspace virtualenv (#17)
- **Update** — `update_comfyui` (core) and `update_all` (all custom nodes) (#18)
- **Models** — `remove_model` (path-safe) and `download_civitai_model` (#19)
- **Workspace & environment** — `get_workspace`, `set_default_workspace`,
  `list_workspaces`, `get_environment` (#20)
- **API / partner nodes** — `list_api_nodes`, `get_api_node_schema`,
  `generate_with_api_node` (#21)
- **ComfyUI-Manager configuration** — `configure_manager` (#22)

### Changed

- Rewrote tool descriptions and parameter docs across the core tool set for
  clearer purpose, usage guidance, and behavioral transparency — improving agent
  tool-selection quality (#23).
- Added a `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `glama.json`, and Glama quality badges
  for the [glama.ai](https://glama.ai) listing.

### Security

- CivitAI authentication is now sent as an `Authorization: Bearer` header instead
  of a `?token=` query parameter, so the API token no longer leaks into logs,
  errors, or redirect URLs. Model-download filenames are validated to stay within
  the models directory (closes a path-traversal hole shared with `download_model`) (#19).
- `COMFY_API_KEY` is delivered to API nodes via the `/prompt` `extra_data` payload
  rather than being placed in the workflow (#21).

### Notes

- Local-management tools (install/update ComfyUI, custom-node installs, model
  removal) require a local install (`COMFYUI_PATH`) and return a clear error when
  targeting a remote instance where the operation cannot apply.
